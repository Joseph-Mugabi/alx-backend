# Caching
```
Caching is a technique used in computer science and information
technology to temporarily store and retrieve data to improve system
performance and reduce the time it takes to access frequently used
information. The idea behind caching is to store copies of data or
computations that are expensive or time-consuming to recreate, 
so they can be quickly retrieved when needed again.

Caching is highly effective in scenarios where data access patterns
exhibit temporal and spatial locality, meaning that recently accessed 
data is likely to be accessed again soon and neighboring data is also 
likely to be accessed shortly after. However, caching introduces the 
challenge of cache consistency, ensuring that cached data is still valid 
and up-to-date. Cache eviction policies are employed to determine which 
data should be removed from the cache when it becomes full.

caching is a crucial optimization technique to enhance the performance 
and efficiency of computer systems and network services,
leading to better user experiences and reduced resource utilization.
